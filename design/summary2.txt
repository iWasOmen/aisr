Comprehensive Conversation Summary: AISR System Development
Project Overview
We have been working on designing and implementing an adaptive&interactive Search and Research (AISR) system - a sophisticated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) platform that uses multiple specialized agents working together to perform deep research. The system features three key feedback loops to continuously improve research quality based on intermediate results.
Initial Design Analysis
We began by analyzing an existing codebase (aisr.py) that implemented a basic multi-agent research system. We identified that while the code contained the necessary components, its structure wasn't ideal for implementing proper feedback loops. The agents were overly coupled, and the workflow orchestration wasn't separating concerns effectively.
System Architecture Redesign
We established a clean architecture with:

Core Components: Memory management, LLM provider, Router
Agents: Specialized LLM-driven components for specific reasoning tasks
Workflows: Orchestration components managing execution flow
Tools: External functionality like web search and crawling

We implemented clear abstractions for:

Component - Base class for all system components
Memory - Multiple memory classes for different contexts
Agent - LLM-driven reasoning components
Workflow - Process orchestration components
Tool - Specific function providers

Implementation Progress
We successfully implemented:

Core infrastructure classes
LLM provider with support for multi-turn conversations
Memory management system
Several workflow classes with simplified designs

Key Design Evolution
After multiple iterations, we identified a cleaner three-layer nested loop architecture:

Task Planning Loop (Outer):

Controls the overall research process
Flow: query → task planning → insight → task executing → replanning → ... → answer
Focuses on "what to research" rather than execution details


Task Executing Loop (Middle):

Processes subtasks sequentially
Flow: receive subtask list → process task1 → process task2 → ... → return results
Focuses on "task ordering and execution"


Search Executing Loop (Inner):

Handles individual subtask execution
Flow: search planning → search execution → (optional crawling) → sub-answer
Focuses on "how to solve a specific task"



Current Implementation State
We've simplified several over-engineered components, removing unnecessary decomposition of tasks that should be handled in a single agent call. The system maintains the key feedback loop concept while being more maintainable.
Next Steps

Implement the three-layer workflow structure we've agreed upon
Create a new TaskExecutingWorkflow class to manage the middle layer
Refine the integration between the three workflow levels
Complete the implementation of the remaining agent classes
Test the system with real queries

This clearer hierarchical structure will make the system more maintainable while preserving the sophisticated research capabilities through multi-agent collaboration and feedback loops.
